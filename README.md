gpupy
=====
over the time I had some fun writing pyhsics simulations using python
OpenGL and OpenCL. Also a prototype plotting engine based on OpenGL 
was developed over time. The aim of this repository is to collect all
working code from previos prototyping and create a clean library from it. 

Old repositories

https://github.com/keksnicoh/gl_plotting_experimental

https://github.com/keksnicoh/numeric_gravity_experimental_2

https://github.com/keksnicoh/opengl_plot_prototype

At the moment this repository grows slowly as a migrate old code and
create new code to finally obtain a nice set of utilities to create
fun OpenGL projects.

demos
=====
The demos implement some scenarios using only plain pyopengl api to
show the basic usage. A demo can be executed by `python -m demos.NAME`.
